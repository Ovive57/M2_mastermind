        How to install:
        python -m pip install git+https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/constance.ganot/mastermind.git
        
        How to run:

        How to play:
        
        The goal of the game is to guess a combination of 4 colors chosen by the computer randomly in maximum 12 ROUNDS.
        For this aim, the program will ask you for a choix of 4 colors among one list of them.
        You need to choose one by one and write it with the right spelling !
        
        After that, the program will give you a sequence of 4 symbols, where: the black symbol means that you
        guessed the right color in the right position, the white symbol means that you guessed the right
        color but not in the right position and the dot mean that the color you have chosen is not among the
        colors of the computer sequence.
        Warning ! The program will give you this sequence randomly organized i.e. for exemple, a black peg in
        the first position do not mean necessarily that the first color you choose is the one that is right in
        the rigt position.
        
        Are you going to be the next Mastermind ?
